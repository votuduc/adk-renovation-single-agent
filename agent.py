fully detailed in the image.
Color Palette: Primarily white cabinets with a dark countertop. Walls are a neutral grey/beige.
II. Cabinet Construction Specifications
Cabinet Type: Frameless (European-style). This means the doors and drawers attach directly to
the cabinet boxes, without a face frame.

interior finish is not visible.
Door and Drawer Front Material: High-gloss white finish. Likely acrylic, laminate, or a high-gloss
lacquer applied to an MDF core.

Base Cabinet Height: Standard counter height, approximately 36" including countertop.
Base Cabinet Depth: Standard depth, approximately 24".
Pantry Cabinet Height: Floor to ceiling.

Several cabinets above the countertop, configured to fit the available space.

Under-cabinet lighting is present (LED strip lights).
Base Cabinets:
One cabinet to the left of the tall cabinet.
Multiple drawers, including one directly under the cooktop.
A cabinet at the very end of the counter next to the right wall.
Tall Cabinet:
Full-height pantry-style cabinet.
Two doors, one above the other.
Island:
Dark countertop matching the perimeter countertops.
Cabinets on the visible side are white.

V. Countertop Specifications
Material: Dark solid surface or stone countertop. Could be quartz, granite, or a similar
engineered stone.
Edge Profile: Slightly eased edge, possibly a small radius.
Thickness: Likely 1 1/4" (3cm).
VI. Appliance Considerations
Cooktop: Integrated, flat, black cooktop (likely induction or electric).
Range Hood: Stainless steel, integrated into the wall cabinets.
Outlets: Outlets are present on the back splash.
VII. Additional Details
Backsplash: Rectangular tile with a horizontal orientation, likely ceramic or glass, in a light color
